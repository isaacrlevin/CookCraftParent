We‚Äôre all doing things we didn‚Äôt expect to during quarantine right? Listening to, learning, experiencing all new things. A blog isn‚Äôt something I planned on doing, but it is something that I have been asked to do by many friends and a few family members over the last five or six years. I have started once or twice, and for one reason or another decided I didn‚Äôt have time, didn‚Äôt have the patience, or didn‚Äôt have the content.

Actually, my biggest motivator right now for starting again is my friends. One in particular. My friend Adriana (follow her on Instagram @AdrianaGHudson) recently posted on her Instagram that she was starting a newsletter ([https://adrianagonzalezhudson.substack.com/](https://adrianagonzalezhudson.substack.com/ "https://adrianagonzalezhudson.substack.com/")) . if you want someone inspirational to follow, I highly suggest her, and signing up for her newsletter once it starts. She shows you all sides to parenting and makes you feel like you can succeed at anything. And while she is my friend, we are also across the country from each other right now, and I still feel like she‚Äôs talking to me on her posts because she‚Äôs that personal and personable. Okay enough bragging on this beauty! Go follow her!

I thought to myself, ‚ÄúIf someone with a full-time job, who just started a company with her husband (go follow that too @upwellcoffee) and has three kids can start a newsletter on top of everything else why can‚Äôt I start this blog?‚Äù It just felt like it was the right time. When else will I have the time, when else will my husband be home to help, when else will I have no excuses. So here we are!

I can‚Äôt promise daily blog posts, I can‚Äôt promise incredibly fun exciting blog posts, I can‚Äôt promise that you‚Äôre going to love everything I have to say. But what I can promise is at least once a week a recap of what we‚Äôve done. Something that maybe you can implement in your own homes, or maybe a yummy recipe, or maybe a fun lesson plan. Or maybe just something for you to laugh at, usually me. I am usually the one to laugh at ![ü§£](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/svg/1f923.svg)
