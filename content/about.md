## I’m Ari and I’m here for you, with you, and because of you.

This is me and my boys S and Z. Before becoming a mom I had a very different view of what my life would be. I had no idea I would be both as content and as unsettled as I am daily as a stay at home mom to two littles. My husband is in the tech space, and tries to get the boys into it as well.

We spend our days learning, cooking, building and exploring. As an English Lit grad with a focus on Secondary Education, and an Usborne Books & More consultant, I have a passion for learning. We find something new in every aspect of our day.

When I am not with the boys I am still cooking, learning and building. A little less exploring as they are usually in the house with me asleep or during quiet time but that is life, am I right?!?
