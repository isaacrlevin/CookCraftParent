We‚Äôve had a crazy two weeks (in the next possible way) last week S started settling better at school but struggle immensely at home. We had quite a few tantrums but got through it. One of the things that randomly helped, was beef jerky ![ü§£](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/svg/1f923.svg) Both my boys like to cook with me and my husband and I‚Äôm always down to get more protein in them. Recently S has been loving beef jerky, but being on dirty keto I don‚Äôt like to waste my carbs on hidden ingredients. So S helped us make some beef jerky on the dehydrated. If you don‚Äôt have one I HIGHLY suggest you get one, we do everything from meat to veggies to fruit and the boys love it all. I‚Äôll link ours and the one we are planning on getting next month below.

Z was his normal easy until he‚Äôs not self, we made some egg crisp crackers and cookies last week. We had our first real Covid outing and brav ed the little zoo. It was really fun. He of course is struggling with not having his brother so if he can‚Äôt have his brother he wants TV and his Paddington. So we have started the process of weaning him off that.

And last Saturday was my husband birthday! Which of course the boys loved, before birthdays OBVIOUSLY mean cake. We woke up and went to breakfast (his was the first birthday in our quarantine bubble to go out actually) and the boys had mac and cheese for breakfast (obviously). We went to the track to run around, went in a painted rock hunt, then came home and baked a a Butter Mochi Cake for Daddy.

Then this week, we met some fun new friends at the beach on Sunday, and just lazed around the house after. Nothing too exciting happened this week, it was just busy. I‚Äôm working on building a table, that I will do a preview post for soon, next months meal plan, and a few other projects here and there. We ended the week at our good friends house where the boys got to play with one of their best friends, and we got to celebrate National Tequila Day. This weekend will be fairly low key, with some possible blueberry picking and LOTS of cleaning and decluttering!
