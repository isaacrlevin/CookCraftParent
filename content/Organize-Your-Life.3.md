Last weekend we ventured out and went blueberry picking. Boy is it hot! I don‚Äôt know about you, but we just don‚Äôt do well in the heat. Especially with masks. But we did it, and it was SUCH a short adventure, but totally worth it. We ended up driving down by the river afterwards and walked around until heading home for lunch.

We also went to a drive in movie this week. We brought our own food, and stayed MOSTLY in our cars. But it was such a treat for the boys. Trying to find something different for them is so important these days. We did buy ice cream sandwiches from a food truck there for dessert.

Whose in the mask game? I just made a few that I‚Äôm loving. Seamless, around the ear, but with ties. They aren‚Äôt the easiest ones but I‚Äôm hoping my little sensory sensitive guy will keep it on.
