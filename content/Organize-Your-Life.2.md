### So it started because….

So let me be real…there is a draft of this post that never ends. There is so much I need to say in order to explain what planning is to me, that I am just going to start with my WHY. Meal planning for our family started out of my need to feel a sense of control over ‘our’ finances, and like I was contributing when Isaac was the one bring home the dough. Because we have moved a ton for his job, and twice essentially to be near my parents when I gave birth to both boys, having a stable job has been difficult for me. I have a ton of side gigs, none of which were ever to make money, they were all to keep me going per say.

Let’s be clear, my husband does not feel like I don’t contribute, in fact I am one of the lucky ones where it is completely the opposite. He feels that my “work” as a Stay At Home Mom is in fact worth more than he makes at his “actual job”. I always blush when he tells people that I am a stay at home mom, because I still struggle with not working in the traditional sense. But every time, I end up blushing because of what he always says next…”I don’t know how she does it. I am so impressed by her.” Or something very similar every time. Someone has to raise your kids right? We just aren’t in a position to have help raising them right now.

### Why are you reading this?

I mean you didn’t just stumble on this right? Something in you maybe wants a lifestyle change, maybe a financial goal you’re reaching for, something you’re saving for. Maybe you just want the challenge, or the sense of control. Whatever it is, write it down, text it to yourself. Have it somewhere you can look at every time it gets hard to plan. When I know it is going to be a rough month, I put it at the top of each of my grocery lists. I use the app ToDo ([https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/ "https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/")) and add my focus as the first item to each list.

### Getting Started

Okay there aren’t many things you actually need physically. Mentally though…just prepare yourself to not be strict. I find that in all things you need some amount of grace or you will fail either way. I don’t mean that to sound harsh, and it is just my opinion based on my personal experience. You do you boo.

Next, come up with your budget. Figure out how much you want your max weekly budget to be. I have managed on as low as $30 a week, it is hard though so don’t expect it to be a breeze, especially if you are used to spending 3/4/5X that regularly. Some people do really well with a cash envelope system. When we were on $30 a week for groceries I used this method and loved it. ESPECIALLY when I was under $30. I should point out that we ONLY count food in our budget (because you don’t eat toilet paper…ew) and that we do, and have almost always done a monthly warehouse run to stock up on the basics such as almond flour and eggs. Here are a few cash envelopes I have heard great things about.

And lastly just a calendar and a pencil. Lord I cannot stress this enough. You need a PENCIL. Again, grace. If you write in pen and have to change things around then you will have a mess which can discourage you down the line. Its the 15th today and I have already switch the 12th, 14th and 15th this month. I mean…I changed it so that we could celebrate National Hot Dog Day because….National Hot Dog Day….

## Stay Tuned for Part 2!!

That should wrap it up for today. Stay tuned for part 2, I will go through how I plan out a month in advance. Thank you so much for hanging out!
